% MOTIVATION
% %
As computing is getting more ubiquitous in our lives, computer infrastructures are getting more complex and software applications are required to meet high level performance.

%

% PROBLEM STATEMENT
% %
In this context, knowing how to design and optimize computer systems and networks is one of the most important skills for software engineers and a strategic asset for companies, both in terms of technology and economical investments.

% APPROACH
% %
In this technical report we propose a next-event simulator to analyze the performance of a Fog computing system serving classed workloads that leverages an off-loading policy between its Edge nodes and the Cloud.

First, we describe the \textit{performance model of the system} in terms of (i) goals, (ii) conceptual model, (iii) specification model, (iv) computational model, (v) verification and (vi) validation.
%
Then, we describe and evaluate the \textit{pseudo-random number generator} used by the simulator, as it is the fundamental building block providing a next-event simulator with random components.

% %
% RESULTS
% %
The experimental results show  the effectiveness of our simulator to study the system and the good randomness degree of its pseudo-random number generator.
