In this technical report we propose a next-event simulator to analyze the performance of a Fog computing system serving classed workloads that leverages an off-loading policy between its Edge nodes and the Cloud.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

From Section~\ref{sec:performance-modeling-goals-and-objectives} to Section~\ref{sec:performance-modeling-validation} we describe the system and its performance following a widely-adopted modeling framework focused on goals, conceptual model, specification model, computational model, verification and validation.

In Section~\ref{sec:analytical-model} we define the analytical model of the system, used as a theoretical baseline to compare to the simulation results.

In Section~\ref{sec:random-number-generation} we describe the pseudo-random number generator used by the simulator to drive the numerical behavior of its random components and show experimental results assessing its randomness degree.

In Section~\ref{sec:evaluation} we show the experimental results covering both the system performance and the randomness degree of the pseudo-random number generator.

In Section~\ref{sec:usage} we show how to configure and run experiments with the simulator command line interface and related tools.

In Section~\ref{sec:conclusions} we conclude the paper by summing up the work that has been done and delineating future improvements.
