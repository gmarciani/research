\section{Verification}
\label{sec:performance-modeling-verification}
The main goal of verification is to assess the consistency of the computational model with the specification model.
The verification has been carried out by evaluating the following consistency checks based on simulator logs and output reports:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{state consistency:} verifies the correctness of the system state evolution, i.e. given an event, it implies the expected system state transition;
	
	\item \textbf{clock consistency:} verifies the correctness of the simulation clock evolution, i.e. given an event, it implies the expected simulation clock transition;
	
	\item \textbf{arrival consistency:} verifies the correctness of arrivals ordering, i.e. given a set of tasks, they took service following the arrival order;
	
	\item \textbf{completion consistency:} verifies the correctness of completion ordering, i.e. given a set of tasks, they leave the system following the ascending ordering key $t_{arrival}+service$;
	
	\item \textbf{flow consistency:} verifies the correctness of the following flow trends:
	
	\begin{equation}
	n_{clt,i}=a_{clt,i}-c_{clt,i}-s_{clt,i}
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
	n_{cld,i}=a_{cld,i}-c_{cld,i}+s_{cld,i}
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
	s_{clt,i}=s_{cld,i}
	\end{equation}
	
	where 
	$n_{j,i}$ is the population in the $j$-th subsystem belonging to $i$-th class of tasks, 
	$a_{j,i}$ is the number of arrivals to the $j$-th subsystem belonging to $i$-th class of tasks,
	$c_{j,i}$ is the number of completions in the $j$-th subsystem belonging to $i$-th class of tasks
	$s_{j,i}$ is the number of switches from/to the $j$-th subsystem belonging to $i$-th class of tasks\footnote{notice that $s_{j,1}=0\forall j=1,2$, as tasks belonging to class $C1$ cannot be switched from Cloudlet to Cloud.}.
	 
	\item \textbf{workload change consistency:} verifies the correctness of performance metrics variations in response to arrival/service rates variations. For example, we verified that some intuitive relations hold true, such as:
	
	\begin{equation}
		\mu_{cld,2}^{new} > \mu_{cld,2}^{old} \Rightarrow E[T_{sys,2}]^{new} < E[T_{sys,2}]^{old}
	\end{equation}
	\\
	and
	
	\begin{equation}
	S^{new} > S^{old} \Rightarrow E[N_{cld,2}]^{new} < E[N_{cld,2}]^{old}
	\end{equation}
	\\
	where $S$ is the threshold for the off-loading algorithm 2.
