\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

In this Section, we present the experimental results, both in terms of performance analysis of the simulated system and the randomness analysis of the adopted pseudo-random number generator.

The experiments have been conducted on an Amazon EC2 c3.8xl instance, which is really indicated for high performance science and engineering applications\footnote{https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/}.
The instance is equipped with 32 vCPU based on an Intel Xeon E5-2680 v2 (Ivy Bridge) processor, 30 GB of RAM and SSD with 900 IOPS.
It runs Debian 8.3 (Jessie), Python 3.5.2, and the Python-ported version of the official Leemis library for discrete-event simulation presented in \cite{leemis2006discrete}.
Our solution has been developed in Pythonv3.9, following most of the de-facto standard code styling best-practices \cite{reitz2016,GooglePythonStyleguide}.
