\section{Experimental Environment}
\label{sec:experimental-analysis}

The experiments have been conducted on an Amazon EC2 c3.8xlarge instance, which is really indicated for high performance science and engineering applications\footnote{https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/}. 
The instance is equipped with 32 vCPU based on an Intel Xeon E5-2680 v2 (Ivy Bridge) processor, 30 GB of RAM and SSD with 900 IOPS. 
It runs Debian 8.3 (Jessie), Python 3.5.2, and the Python-ported version of the official Leemis library for discrete-event simulation, indicated in \cite{leemis2006discrete}.

Our solution has been developed in Python, following the de-facto standard best-practices, stated in \cite{reitz2016,GooglePythonStyleguide}. For the production of plots Matplotlib 1.5.3 has been used.

The simulations are replicated several times to clear out the weight of unrepresentative subsequences.
Statisticians discard outliers as being unrepresentative, but it is not appropriate to do it in simulation.
