%\hlr{non so se convenga usare il will oppure could (quindi chiamare la sezione Further Improvements?) perch\'e possono essere delle migliorie che identifichiamo ma, non avendo al momento un interesse diretto nell'analitica su grafi, non sappiamo se voler implementare.}

Leveraging the experience gathered to answer the DEBS grand challenge, we identify the following improvements. 
%
%We will extreme the inner parallelization of the operators and reduce the complexity of clique calculation, by adopting special purpose heuristics. 
We will exploit a finer-grained parallelism by enhancing the application components with more sophisticated data structures and operations, which enable concurrent and efficient updates.
%
%To further reduce the average application latency, we will store tuple's fields not regularly involved in the ranking calculation and retrieve them downstream only when necessary in the emission of a new ranking (i.e. post author's name) or in not too frequent comparisons (i.e comment's content). 
To further reduce the average application latency, we will decouple the social events (e.g., post, comment, like) from their content (e.g., post message), so to reduce the streams transmission time.
%
Finally, we could make the feedback stream self-adaptive, so to properly handle the  backpressure mechanism, even when posts expire with an unpredictable rate.
