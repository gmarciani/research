\section{Architecture}
\label{sec:architecture}

Since the development of a real botnet goes beyond the scope of this work, we adhere to an architecture that allows us to focus on the development of a bot, thought for testing and educational showcase, but actually ready for a real scenario. \Cref{fig:botnet-architecture} shows our botnet reference architecture.

The reference architecture models a bot that can be instructed by a centralized controller.
Here, a controller is defined giving three interfaces: the \textit{init interface} is the one through wich the bot joins the botnet loading specific configuration; the \textit{command interface} is the one through which the bot loads commands to execute; the \textit{log interface} is the one that the bot submits analysis reports to.

Such a model makes our bot is suitable both for local testing, where interfaces are local files, and real controller interaction, where interfaces are REST interfaces.

Our bot can be configured by a convenient Web User Interface (WUI) described in \Cref{sec:configuration-wui}. The commands it can execute are given as JSON file. These files can be both local files and remote controller responses. They can be conveniently created by a WUI described in \Cref{sec:commands-wui}.
