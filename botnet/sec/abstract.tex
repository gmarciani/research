Botnets are tools to convey malwares and control unaware distributed computing power.
Their first priority is to spread unnoticed, because in this way they may generate huge profits.
They span infecting computer with bot malwares forcing them to join the network, unwittingly.
In this work we describe the implementation of a bot, though for botnets with a centralized command and control layer.
The bot is fundamentally thought as an educational showcase, but it is actually ready to interact with a real web controller and configurable via a web-based interface.
