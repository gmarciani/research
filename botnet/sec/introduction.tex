\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

This work describes the implementation of a bot though for botnets with a centralized command and control (C\&C) layer. The bot is distributed as an open source project at \cite{project-repo}.
In \Cref{sec:botnets} we provide a brief botnets overview to better contextualize our work.
In \Cref{sec:architecture} we describe the reference architecture adopted in the bot development.
In \Cref{sec:bot} we show how the bot has been modeled as a finite state automaton, giving the pseudocode of each state.
In \Cref{sec:configuration} we show how the bot can be configured and a convenient web-based tool to do it.
In \Cref{sec:commands} we lists all the available commands, giving their JSON schema, and a web-based tool to produce them.
In \Cref{sec:reports} we show the host and network analysis the bot can perform.
In \Cref{sec:implementation} we show how the bot has been implemented, with a focus on adopted technologies and code obfuscation.
In \Cref{sec:usage} we give compilation and usage instructions.
In \Cref{sec:sample-execution} we show a sample execution with the strictly relevant output.
In \Cref{sec:further-improvements} we point out some further improvements for our bot.
In \Cref{sec:conclusions} we finally give our conclusion on the developed bot.
