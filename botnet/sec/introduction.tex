\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

This work describes the open source project \texttt{botnet}, distributed at \cite{project-repo}.
In \Cref{sec:architecture} we show the reference botnet architecture.
In \Cref{sec:bot} we show how the bot has been modeled as a finite state automaton.
In \Cref{sec:configuration} we show the configurable aspects of the bot and a convenient tool to configure it.
In \Cref{sec:commands} we lists all available commands, giving their JSON schema, and a convenient tool to produce them.
In \Cref{sec:host-analysis} we show what kind of analysis the bot can do.
In \Cref{sec:implementation} we show how the bot has been implemented.
In \Cref{sec:usage} we give usage instructions and some sample executions.
In \Cref{sec:further-improvements} we point out some further improvements both on bot and controller.
In \Cref{sec:conclusions} we finally give our conclusion on the developed botnet showcase.
