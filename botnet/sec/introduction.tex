\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

In \Cref{sec:architecture} we show the reference botnet architecture.
In \Cref{sec:bot} we show how the bot has been modeled as a finite state automaton.
In \Cref{sec:controller} we show how a controller is defined.
In \Cref{sec:configuration} we show how to configure the bot.
In \Cref{sec:commands} we lists all available commands, giving their JSON schema and some examples.
In \Cref{sec:host-analysis} we show what kind of analysis the bot can do.
In \Cref{sec:bot-implementation} we show how the bot has been implemented.
In \Cref{sec:controller-implementation} we show how the controller has been implemented.
In \Cref{sec:usage} we give usage instructions and some sample executions.
In \Cref{sec:further-improvements} we point out some further improvements both on bot and controller.
In \Cref{sec:conclusions} we finally give our conclusion on the developed botnet showcase.
