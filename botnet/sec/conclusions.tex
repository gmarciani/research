\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this work we showed how to develop a bot, thought for testing and educational showcase, but actually ready for a real scenario.
The implemented architecture makes it really easy to extend the bot code for educational experimentations. 
Our bot is configurable and instructable by convenient web user interfaces.
