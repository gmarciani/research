  Microservices

a definition of this new architectural term

/The term "Microservice Architecture" has sprung up over the last few
years to describe a particular way of designing software applications as
suites of independently deployable services. While there is no precise
definition of this architectural style, there are certain common
characteristics around organization around business capability,
automated deployment, intelligence in the endpoints, and decentralized
control of languages and data. /

"Microservices" - yet another new term on the crowded streets of
software architecture. Although our natural inclination is to pass such
things by with a contemptuous glance, this bit of terminology describes
a style of software systems that we are finding more and more appealing.
We've seen many projects use this style in the last few years, and
results so far have been positive, so much so that for many of our
colleagues this is becoming the default style for building enterprise
applications. Sadly, however, there's not much information that outlines
what the microservice style is and how to do it.

In short, the microservice architectural style [1] <#footnote-etymology>
is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small
services, each running in its own process and communicating with
lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. These services are
built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully
automated deployment machinery. There is a bare minimum of centralized
management of these services, which may be written in different
programming languages and use different data storage technologies.

<https://martinfowler.com/microservices>

My Microservices Resource Guide <https://martinfowler.com/microservices>
provides links to the best articles, videos, books, and podcasts about
microservices.

To start explaining the microservice style it's useful to compare it to
the monolithic style: a monolithic application built as a single unit.
Enterprise Applications are often built in three main parts: a
client-side user interface (consisting of HTML pages and javascript
running in a browser on the user's machine) a database (consisting of
many tables inserted into a common, and usually relational, database
management system), and a server-side application. The server-side
application will handle HTTP requests, execute domain logic, retrieve
and update data from the database, and select and populate HTML views to
be sent to the browser. This server-side application is a /monolith/ - a
single logical executable[2] <#footnote-monolith>. Any changes to the
system involve building and deploying a new version of the server-side
application.

Such a monolithic server is a natural way to approach building such a
system. All your logic for handling a request runs in a single process,
allowing you to use the basic features of your language to divide up the
application into classes, functions, and namespaces. With some care, you
can run and test the application on a developer's laptop, and use a
deployment pipeline to ensure that changes are properly tested and
deployed into production. You can horizontally scale the monolith by
running many instances behind a load-balancer.

Monolithic applications can be successful, but increasingly people are
feeling frustrations with them - especially as more applications are
being deployed to the cloud . Change cycles are tied together - a change
made to a small part of the application, requires the entire monolith to
be rebuilt and deployed. Over time it's often hard to keep a good
modular structure, making it harder to keep changes that ought to only
affect one module within that module. Scaling requires scaling of the
entire application rather than parts of it that require greater resource.

Figure 1: Monoliths and Microservices

These frustrations have led to the microservice architectural style:
building applications as suites of services. As well as the fact that
services are independently deployable and scalable, each service also
provides a firm module boundary, even allowing for different services to
be written in different programming languages. They can also be managed
by different teams .

We do not claim that the microservice style is novel or innovative, its
roots go back at least to the design principles of Unix. But we do think
that not enough people consider a microservice architecture and that
many software developments would be better off if they used it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    Characteristics of a Microservice Architecture

We cannot say there is a formal definition of the microservices
architectural style, but we can attempt to describe what we see as
common characteristics for architectures that fit the label. As with any
definition that outlines common characteristics, not all microservice
architectures have all the characteristics, but we do expect that most
microservice architectures exhibit most characteristics. While we
authors have been active members of this rather loose community, our
intention is to attempt a description of what we see in our own work and
in similar efforts by teams we know of. In particular we are not laying
down some definition to conform to.


      Componentization via Services

For as long as we've been involved in the software industry, there's
been a desire to build systems by plugging together components, much in
the way we see things are made in the physical world. During the last
couple of decades we've seen considerable progress with large
compendiums of common libraries that are part of most language platforms.

When talking about components we run into the difficult definition of
what makes a component. Our definition is that a *component* is a unit
of software that is independently replaceable and upgradeable.

Microservice architectures will use libraries, but their primary way of
componentizing their own software is by breaking down into services. We
define *libraries* as components that are linked into a program and
called using in-memory function calls, while *services* are
out-of-process components who communicate with a mechanism such as a web
service request, or remote procedure call. (This is a different concept
to that of a service object in many OO programs [3]
<#footnote-service-object>.)

One main reason for using services as components (rather than libraries)
is that services are independently deployable. If you have an
application [4] <#footnote-application> that consists of a multiple
libraries in a single process, a change to any single component results
in having to redeploy the entire application. But if that application is
decomposed into multiple services, you can expect many single service
changes to only require that service to be redeployed. That's not an
absolute, some changes will change service interfaces resulting in some
coordination, but the aim of a good microservice architecture is to
minimize these through cohesive service boundaries and evolution
mechanisms in the service contracts.

Another consequence of using services as components is a more explicit
component interface. Most languages do not have a good mechanism for
defining an explicit Published Interface
<https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PublishedInterface.html>. Often it's
only documentation and discipline that prevents clients breaking a
component's encapsulation, leading to overly-tight coupling between
components. Services make it easier to avoid this by using explicit
remote call mechanisms.

Using services like this does have downsides. Remote calls are more
expensive than in-process calls, and thus remote APIs need to be
coarser-grained, which is often more awkward to use. If you need to
change the allocation of responsibilities between components, such
movements of behavior are harder to do when you're crossing process
boundaries.

At a first approximation, we can observe that services map to runtime
processes, but that is only a first approximation. A service may consist
of multiple processes that will always be developed and deployed
together, such as an application process and a database that's only used
by that service.


      Organized around Business Capabilities

When looking to split a large application into parts, often management
focuses on the technology layer, leading to UI teams, server-side logic
teams, and database teams. When teams are separated along these lines,
even simple changes can lead to a cross-team project taking time and
budgetary approval. A smart team will optimise around this and plump for
the lesser of two evils - just force the logic into whichever
application they have access to. Logic everywhere in other words. This
is an example of Conway's Law[5] <#footnote-conwayslaw> in action.

    Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will
    produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's
    communication structure.

    -- Melvyn Conway, 1967

Figure 2: Conway's Law in action

The microservice approach to division is different, splitting up into
services organized around *business capability*. Such services take a
broad-stack implementation of software for that business area, including
user-interface, persistant storage, and any external collaborations.
Consequently the teams are cross-functional, including the full range of
skills required for the development: user-experience, database, and
project management.

Figure 3: Service boundaries reinforced by team boundaries


      How big is a microservice?

Although “microservice” has become a popular name for this architectural
style, its name does lead to an unfortunate focus on the size of
service, and arguments about what constitutes “micro”. In our
conversations with microservice practitioners, we see a range of sizes
of services. The largest sizes reported follow Amazon's notion of the
Two Pizza Team (i.e. the whole team can be fed by two pizzas), meaning
no more than a dozen people. On the smaller size scale we've seen setups
where a team of half-a-dozen would support half-a-dozen services.

This leads to the question of whether there are sufficiently large
differences within this size range that the service-per-dozen-people and
service-per-person sizes shouldn't be lumped under one microservices
label. At the moment we think it's better to group them together, but
it's certainly possible that we'll change our mind as we explore this
style further.

One company organised in this way is www.comparethemarket.com
<http://www.comparethemarket.com/>. Cross functional teams are
responsible for building and operating each product and each product is
split out into a number of individual services communicating via a
message bus.

Large monolithic applications can always be modularized around business
capabilities too, although that's not the common case. Certainly we
would urge a large team building a monolithic application to divide
itself along business lines. The main issue we have seen here, is that
they tend to be organised around /too many/ contexts. If the monolith
spans many of these modular boundaries it can be difficult for
individual members of a team to fit them into their short-term memory.
Additionally we see that the modular lines require a great deal of
discipline to enforce. The necessarily more explicit separation required
by service components makes it easier to keep the team boundaries clear.


      Products not Projects

Most application development efforts that we see use a project model:
where the aim is to deliver some piece of software which is then
considered to be completed. On completion the software is handed over to
a maintenance organization and the project team that built it is disbanded.

Microservice proponents tend to avoid this model, preferring instead the
notion that a team should own a product over its full lifetime. A common
inspiration for this is Amazon's notion of "you build, you run it"
<https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1142065> where a development team
takes full responsibility for the software in production. This brings
developers into day-to-day contact with how their software behaves in
production and increases contact with their users, as they have to take
on at least some of the support burden.

The product mentality, ties in with the linkage to business
capabilities. Rather than looking at the software as a set of
functionality to be completed, there is an on-going relationship where
the question is how can software assist its users to enhance the
business capability.

There's no reason why this same approach can't be taken with monolithic
applications, but the smaller granularity of services can make it easier
to create the personal relationships between service developers and
their users.


      Smart endpoints and dumb pipes

When building communication structures between different processes,
we've seen many products and approaches that stress putting significant
smarts into the communication mechanism itself. A good example of this
is the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), where ESB products often include
sophisticated facilities for message routing, choreography,
transformation, and applying business rules.


      Microservices and SOA

When we've talked about microservices a common question is whether this
is just Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) that we saw a decade ago.
There is merit to this point, because the microservice style is very
similar to what some advocates of SOA have been in favor of. The
problem, however, is that SOA means too many different things
<https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ServiceOrientedAmbiguity.html>, and that
most of the time that we come across something called "SOA" it's
significantly different to the style we're describing here, usually due
to a focus on ESBs used to integrate monolithic applications.

In particular we have seen so many botched implementations of service
orientation - from the tendency to hide complexity away in ESB's [6]
<#footnote-esb>, to failed multi-year initiatives that cost millions and
deliver no value, to centralised governance models that actively inhibit
change, that it is sometimes difficult to see past these problems.

Certainly, many of the techniques in use in the microservice community
have grown from the experiences of developers integrating services in
large organisations. The Tolerant Reader
<https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TolerantReader.html> pattern is an
example of this. Efforts to use the web have contributed, using simple
protocols is another approach derived from these experiences - a
reaction away from central standards that have reached a complexity that
is, frankly, breathtaking
<http://wiki.apache.org/ws/WebServiceSpecifications>. (Any time you need
an ontology to manage your ontologies you know you are in deep trouble.)

This common manifestation of SOA has led some microservice advocates to
reject the SOA label entirely, although others consider microservices to
be one form of SOA [7] <#footnote-fine-grained>, perhaps /service
orientation done right/. Either way, the fact that SOA means such
different things means it's valuable to have a term that more crisply
defines this architectural style.

The microservice community favours an alternative approach: /smart
endpoints and dumb pipes/. Applications built from microservices aim to
be as decoupled and as cohesive as possible - they own their own domain
logic and act more as filters in the classical Unix sense - receiving a
request, applying logic as appropriate and producing a response. These
are choreographed using simple RESTish protocols rather than complex
protocols such as WS-Choreography or BPEL or orchestration by a central
tool.

The two protocols used most commonly are HTTP request-response with
resource API's and lightweight messaging[8] <#footnote-protobufs>. The
best expression of the first is

    Be of the web, not behind the web

    -- Ian Robinson
    <https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596805829?ie=UTF8&tag=martinfowlerc-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0596805829>

Microservice teams use the principles and protocols that the world wide
web (and to a large extent, Unix) is built on. Often used resources can
be cached with very little effort on the part of developers or
operations folk.

The second approach in common use is messaging over a lightweight
message bus. The infrastructure chosen is typically dumb (dumb as in
acts as a message router only) - simple implementations such as RabbitMQ
or ZeroMQ don't do much more than provide a reliable asynchronous fabric
- the smarts still live in the end points that are producing and
consuming messages; in the services.

In a monolith, the components are executing in-process and communication
between them is via either method invocation or function call. The
biggest issue in changing a monolith into microservices lies in changing
the communication pattern. A naive conversion from in-memory method
calls to RPC leads to chatty communications which don't perform well.
Instead you need to replace the fine-grained communication with a
coarser -grained approach.


      Decentralized Governance

One of the consequences of centralised governance is the tendency to
standardise on single technology platforms. Experience shows that this
approach is constricting - not every problem is a nail and not every
solution a hammer. We prefer using the right tool for the job and while
monolithic applications can take advantage of different languages to a
certain extent, it isn't that common.

Splitting the monolith's components out into services we have a choice
when building each of them. You want to use Node.js to standup a simple
reports page? Go for it. C++ for a particularly gnarly near-real-time
component? Fine. You want to swap in a different flavour of database
that better suits the read behaviour of one component? We have the
technology to rebuild him.

Of course, just because you /can/ do something, doesn't mean you
/should/ - but partitioning your system in this way means you have the
option.

Teams building microservices prefer a different approach to standards
too. Rather than use a set of defined standards written down somewhere
on paper they prefer the idea of producing useful tools that other
developers can use to solve similar problems to the ones they are
facing. These tools are usually harvested from implementations and
shared with a wider group, sometimes, but not exclusively using an
internal open source model. Now that git and github have become the de
facto version control system of choice, open source practices are
becoming more and more common in-house .

Netflix is a good example of an organisation that follows this
philosophy. Sharing useful and, above all, battle-tested code as
libraries encourages other developers to solve similar problems in
similar ways yet leaves the door open to picking a different approach if
required. Shared libraries tend to be focused on common problems of data
storage, inter-process communication and as we discuss further below,
infrastructure automation.

For the microservice community, overheads are particularly unattractive.
That isn't to say that the community doesn't value service contracts.
Quite the opposite, since there tend to be many more of them. It's just
that they are looking at different ways of managing those contracts.
Patterns like Tolerant Reader
<https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TolerantReader.html> and Consumer-Driven
Contracts
<https://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html> are
often applied to microservices. These aid service contracts in evolving
independently. Executing consumer driven contracts as part of your build
increases confidence and provides fast feedback on whether your services
are functioning. Indeed we know of a team in Australia who drive the
build of new services with consumer driven contracts. They use simple
tools that allow them to define the contract for a service. This becomes
part of the automated build before code for the new service is even
written. The service is then built out only to the point where it
satisfies the contract - an elegant approach to avoid the 'YAGNI'[9]
<#footnote-YAGNI> dilemma when building new software. These techniques
and the tooling growing up around them, limit the need for central
contract management by decreasing the temporal coupling between services.


      Many languages, many options

The growth of JVM as a platform is just the latest example of mixing
languages within a common platform. It's been common practice to
shell-out to a higher level language to take advantage of higher level
abstractions for decades. As is dropping down to the metal and writing
performance sensitive code in a lower level one. However, many monoliths
don't need this level of performance optimisation nor are DSL's and
higher level abstractions that common (to our dismay). Instead monoliths
are usually single language and the tendency is to limit the number of
technologies in use [10] <#footnote-many-languages>.

Perhaps the apogee of decentralised governance is the build it / run it
ethos popularised by Amazon. Teams are responsible for all aspects of
the software they build including operating the software 24/7.
Devolution of this level of responsibility is definitely not the norm
but we do see more and more companies pushing responsibility to the
development teams. Netflix is another organisation that has adopted this
ethos[11] <#footnote-netflix-flowcon>. Being woken up at 3am every night
by your pager is certainly a powerful incentive to focus on quality when
writing your code. These ideas are about as far away from the
traditional centralized governance model as it is possible to be.


      Decentralized Data Management

Decentralization of data management presents in a number of different
ways. At the most abstract level, it means that the conceptual model of
the world will differ between systems. This is a common issue when
integrating across a large enterprise, the sales view of a customer will
differ from the support view. Some things that are called customers in
the sales view may not appear at all in the support view. Those that do
may have different attributes and (worse) common attributes with subtly
different semantics.


      Battle-tested standards and enforced standards

It's a bit of a dichotomy that microservice teams tend to eschew the
kind of rigid enforced standards laid down by enterprise architecture
groups but will happily use and even evangelise the use of open
standards such as HTTP, ATOM and other microformats.

The key difference is how the standards are developed and how they are
enforced. Standards managed by groups such as the IETF only /become/
standards when there are several live implementations of them in the
wider world and which often grow from successful open-source projects.

These standards are a world apart from many in a corporate world, which
are often developed by groups that have little recent programming
experience or overly influenced by vendors.

This issue is common between applications, but can also occur /within/
applications, particular when that application is divided into separate
components. A useful way of thinking about this is the Domain-Driven
Design notion of Bounded Context
<https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html>. DDD divides a
complex domain up into multiple bounded contexts and maps out the
relationships between them. This process is useful for both monolithic
and microservice architectures, but there is a natural correlation
between service and context boundaries that helps clarify, and as we
describe in the section on business capabilities, reinforce the separations.

As well as decentralizing decisions about conceptual models,
microservices also decentralize data storage decisions. While monolithic
applications prefer a single logical database for persistant data,
enterprises often prefer a single database across a range of
applications - many of these decisions driven through vendor's
commercial models around licensing. Microservices prefer letting each
service manage its own database, either different instances of the same
database technology, or entirely different database systems - an
approach called Polyglot Persistence
<https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PolyglotPersistence.html>. You can use
polyglot persistence in a monolith, but it appears more frequently with
microservices.

Decentralizing responsibility for data across microservices has
implications for managing updates. The common approach to dealing with
updates has been to use transactions to guarantee consistency when
updating multiple resources. This approach is often used within monoliths.

Using transactions like this helps with consistency, but imposes
significant temporal coupling, which is problematic across multiple
services. Distributed transactions are notoriously difficult to
implement and as a consequence microservice architectures emphasize
transactionless coordination between services
<http://www.eaipatterns.com/ramblings/18_starbucks.html>, with explicit
recognition that consistency may only be eventual consistency and
problems are dealt with by compensating operations.

Choosing to manage inconsistencies in this way is a new challenge for
many development teams, but it is one that often matches business
practice. Often businesses handle a degree of inconsistency in order to
respond quickly to demand, while having some kind of reversal process to
deal with mistakes. The trade-off is worth it as long as the cost of
fixing mistakes is less than the cost of lost business under greater
consistency.


      Infrastructure Automation

Infrastructure automation techniques have evolved enormously over the
last few years - the evolution of the cloud and AWS in particular has
reduced the operational complexity of building, deploying and operating
microservices.

Many of the products or systems being build with microservices are being
built by teams with extensive experience of Continuous Delivery
<https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html> and it's
precursor, Continuous Integration
<https://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html>. Teams
building software this way make extensive use of infrastructure
automation techniques. This is illustrated in the build pipeline shown
below.

Figure 5: basic build pipeline

Since this isn't an article on Continuous Delivery we will call
attention to just a couple of key features here. We want as much
confidence as possible that our software is working, so we run lots of
*automated tests*. Promotion of working software 'up' the pipeline means
we *automate deployment* to each new environment.


      Make it easy to do the right thing

One side effect we have found of increased automation as a consequence
of continuous delivery and deployment is the creation of useful tools to
help developers and operations folk. Tooling for creating artefacts,
managing codebases, standing up simple services or for adding standard
monitoring and logging are pretty common now. The best example on the
web is probably Netflix's set of open source tools
<http://netflix.github.io/>, but there are others including Dropwizard
<http://dropwizard.codahale.com/> which we have used extensively.

A monolithic application will be built, tested and pushed through these
environments quite happlily. It turns out that once you have invested in
automating the path to production for a monolith, then deploying /more/
applications doesn't seem so scary any more. Remember, one of the aims
of CD is to make deployment boring, so whether its one or three
applications, as long as its still boring it doesn't matter[12]
<#footnote-trickycd>.

Another area where we see teams using extensive infrastructure
automation is when managing microservices in production. In contrast to
our assertion above that as long as deployment is boring there isn't
that much difference between monoliths and microservices, the
operational landscape for each can be strikingly different.

Figure 6: Module deployment often differs


      Design for failure

A consequence of using services as components, is that applications need
to be designed so that they can tolerate the failure of services. Any
service call could fail due to unavailability of the supplier, the
client has to respond to this as gracefully as possible. This is a
disadvantage compared to a monolithic design as it introduces additional
complexity to handle it. The consequence is that microservice teams
constantly reflect on how service failures affect the user experience.
Netflix's Simian Army <https://github.com/Netflix/SimianArmy> induces
failures of services and even datacenters during the working day to test
both the application's resilience and monitoring.


      The circuit breaker and production ready code

Circuit Breaker <https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html>
appears in Release It!
<https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A32NXZO?ie=UTF8&tag=martinfowlerc-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00A32NXZO>
alongside other patterns such as Bulkhead and Timeout. Implemented
together, these patterns are crucially important when building
communicating applications. This Netflix blog entry
<http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/02/fault-tolerance-in-high-volume.html> does
a great job of explaining their application of them.

This kind of automated testing in production would be enough to give
most operation groups the kind of shivers usually preceding a week off
work. This isn't to say that monolithic architectural styles aren't
capable of sophisticated monitoring setups - it's just less common in
our experience.

Since services can fail at any time, it's important to be able to detect
the failures quickly and, if possible, automatically restore service.
Microservice applications put a lot of emphasis on real-time monitoring
of the application, checking both architectural elements (how many
requests per second is the database getting) and business relevant
metrics (such as how many orders per minute are received). Semantic
monitoring can provide an early warning system of something going wrong
that triggers development teams to follow up and investigate.

This is particularly important to a microservices architecture because
the microservice preference towards choreography and event collaboration
<https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventCollaboration.html> leads to
emergent behavior. While many pundits praise the value of serendipitous
emergence, the truth is that emergent behavior can sometimes be a bad
thing. Monitoring is vital to spot bad emergent behavior quickly so it
can be fixed.


      Synchronous calls considered harmful

Any time you have a number of synchronous calls between services you
will encounter the multiplicative effect of downtime. Simply, this is
when the downtime of your system becomes the product of the downtimes of
the individual components. You face a choice, making your calls
asynchronous or managing the downtime. At www.guardian.co.uk they have
implemented a simple rule on the new platform - one synchronous call per
user request while at Netflix, their platform API redesign has built
asynchronicity into the API fabric.

Monoliths can be built to be as transparent as a microservice - in fact,
they should be. The difference is that you absolutely need to know when
services running in different processes are disconnected. With libraries
within the same process this kind of transparency is less likely to be
useful.

Microservice teams would expect to see sophisticated monitoring and
logging setups for each individual service such as dashboards showing
up/down status and a variety of operational and business relevant
metrics. Details on circuit breaker status, current throughput and
latency are other examples we often encounter in the wild.


      Evolutionary Design

Microservice practitioners, usually have come from an evolutionary
design background and see service decomposition as a further tool to
enable application developers to control changes in their application
without slowing down change. Change control doesn't necessarily mean
change reduction - with the right attitudes and tools you can make
frequent, fast, and well-controlled changes to software.

Whenever you try to break a software system into components, you're
faced with the decision of how to divide up the pieces - what are the
principles on which we decide to slice up our application? The key
property of a component is the notion of independent replacement and
upgradeability[13] <#footnote-RCA> - which implies we look for points
where we can imagine rewriting a component without affecting its
collaborators. Indeed many microservice groups take this further by
explicitly expecting many services to be scrapped rather than evolved in
the longer term.

The Guardian website is a good example of an application that was
designed and built as a monolith, but has been evolving in a
microservice direction. The monolith still is the core of the website,
but they prefer to add new features by building microservices that use
the monolith's API. This approach is particularly handy for features
that are inherently temporary, such as specialized pages to handle a
sporting event. Such a part of the website can quickly be put together
using rapid development languages, and removed once the event is over.
We've seen similar approaches at a financial institution where new
services are added for a market opportunity and discarded after a few
months or even weeks.

This emphasis on replaceability is a special case of a more general
principle of modular design, which is to drive modularity through the
pattern of change [14] <#footnote-beck-rate-of-change>. You want to keep
things that change at the same time in the same module. Parts of a
system that change rarely should be in different services to those that
are currently undergoing lots of churn. If you find yourself repeatedly
changing two services together, that's a sign that they should be merged.

Putting components into services adds an opportunity for more granular
release planning. With a monolith any changes require a full build and
deployment of the entire application. With microservices, however, you
only need to redeploy the service(s) you modified. This can simplify and
speed up the release process. The downside is that you have to worry
about changes to one service breaking its consumers. The traditional
integration approach is to try to deal with this problem using
versioning, but the preference in the microservice world is to only use
versioning as a last resort
<https://martinfowler.com/articles/enterpriseREST.html#versioning>. We
can avoid a lot of versioning by designing services to be as tolerant as
possible to changes in their suppliers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    Are Microservices the Future?

Our main aim in writing this article is to explain the major ideas and
principles of microservices. By taking the time to do this we clearly
think that the microservices architectural style is an important idea -
one worth serious consideration for enterprise applications. We have
recently built several systems using the style and know of others who
have used and favor this approach.

Those we know about who are in some way pioneering the architectural
style include Amazon, Netflix, The Guardian
<http://www.theguardian.com/>, the UK Government Digital Service
<https://gds.blog.gov.uk/>, realestate.com.au
<https://martinfowler.com/articles/realestate.com.au>, Forward and
comparethemarket.com <http://www.comparethemarket.com/>. The conference
circuit in 2013 was full of examples of companies that are moving to
something that would class as microservices - including Travis CI. In
addition there are plenty of organizations that have long been doing
what we would class as microservices, but without ever using the name.
(Often this is labelled as SOA - although, as we've said, SOA comes in
many contradictory forms. [15] <#footnote-already>)

Despite these positive experiences, however, we aren't arguing that we
are certain that microservices are the future direction for software
architectures. While our experiences so far are positive compared to
monolithic applications, we're conscious of the fact that not enough
time has passed for us to make a full judgement.

<https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491950358?ie=UTF8&tag=martinfowlerc-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1491950358>

Our colleague Sam Newman spent most of 2014 working on a book that
captures our experiences with building microservices
<https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491950358?ie=UTF8&tag=martinfowlerc-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1491950358>.
This should be your next step if you want a deeper dive into the topic.

Often the true consequences of your architectural decisions are only
evident several years after you made them. We have seen projects where a
good team, with a strong desire for modularity, has built a monolithic
architecture that has decayed over the years. Many people believe that
such decay is less likely with microservices, since the service
boundaries are explicit and hard to patch around. Yet until we see
enough systems with enough age, we can't truly assess how microservice
architectures mature.

There are certainly reasons why one might expect microservices to mature
poorly. In any effort at componentization, success depends on how well
the software fits into components. It's hard to figure out exactly where
the component boundaries should lie. Evolutionary design recognizes the
difficulties of getting boundaries right and thus the importance of it
being easy to refactor them. But when your components are services with
remote communications, then refactoring is much harder than with
in-process libraries. Moving code is difficult across service
boundaries, any interface changes need to be coordinated between
participants, layers of backwards compatibility need to be added, and
testing is made more complicated.

Another issue is If the components do not compose cleanly, then all you
are doing is shifting complexity from inside a component to the
connections between components. Not just does this just move complexity
around, it moves it to a place that's less explicit and harder to
control. It's easy to think things are better when you are looking at
the inside of a small, simple component, while missing messy connections
between services.

Finally, there is the factor of team skill. New techniques tend to be
adopted by more skillful teams. But a technique that is more effective
for a more skillful team isn't necessarily going to work for less
skillful teams. We've seen plenty of cases of less skillful teams
building messy monolithic architectures, but it takes time to see what
happens when this kind of mess occurs with microservices. A poor team
will always create a poor system - it's very hard to tell if
microservices reduce the mess in this case or make it worse.

One reasonable argument we've heard is that you shouldn't start with a
microservices architecture. Instead begin with a monolith
<https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html>, keep it modular,
and split it into microservices once the monolith becomes a problem.
(Although this advice isn't ideal
<https://martinfowler.com/articles/dont-start-monolith.html>, since a
good in-process interface is usually not a good service interface.)

So we write this with cautious optimism. So far, we've seen enough about
the microservice style to feel that it can be a worthwhile road to tread
<https://martinfowler.com/microservices/>. We can't say for sure where
we'll end up, but one of the challenges of software development is that
you can only make decisions based on the imperfect information that you
currently have to hand.

    Footnotes

1: The term "microservice" was discussed at a workshop of software
architects near Venice in May, 2011 to describe what the participants
saw as a common architectural style that many of them had been recently
exploring. In May 2012, the same group decided on "microservices" as the
most appropriate name. James presented some of these ideas as a case
study in March 2012 at 33rd Degree in Krakow in Microservices - Java,
the Unix Way <http://2012.33degree.org/talk/show/67> as did Fred George
about the same time
<http://www.slideshare.net/fredgeorge/micro-service-architecure>. Adrian
Cockcroft at Netflix, describing this approach as "fine grained SOA" was
pioneering the style at web scale as were many of the others mentioned
in this article - Joe Walnes, Dan North, Evan Botcher and Graham Tackley.

2: The term monolith has been in use by the Unix community for some
time. It appears in The Art of Unix Programming
<https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003U2T5BA?ie=UTF8&tag=martinfowlerc-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B003U2T5BA>
to describe systems that get too big.

3: Many object-oriented designers, including ourselves, use the term
service object in the Domain-Driven Design
<https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321125215?ie=UTF8&tag=martinfowlerc-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321125215>
sense for an object that carries out a significant process that isn't
tied to an entity. This is a different concept to how we're using
"service" in this article. Sadly the term service has both meanings and
we have to live with the polyseme.

4: We consider an application to be a social construction
<https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ApplicationBoundary.html> that binds
together a code base, group of functionality, and body of funding.

5: The original paper can be found on Melvyn Conway's website here
<http://www.melconway.com/Home/Committees_Paper.html>

6: We can't resist mentioning Jim Webber's statement that ESB stands for
"Egregious Spaghetti Box"
<http://www.infoq.com/presentations/soa-without-esb>.

7: Netflix makes the link explicit - until recently referring to their
architectural style as fine-grained SOA.

8: At extremes of scale, organisations often move to binary protocols -
protobufs <https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/> for example. Systems
using these still exhibit the characteristic of smart endpoints, dumb
pipes - and trade off /transparency/ for scale. Most web properties and
certainly the vast majority of enterprises don't need to make this
tradeoff - transparency can be a big win.

9: "YAGNI" or "You Aren't Going To Need It" is an XP principle
<http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?YouArentGonnaNeedIt> and exhortation to not add
features until you know you need them.

10: It's a little disengenuous of us to claim that monoliths are single
language - in order to build systems on todays web, you probably need to
know JavaScript and XHTML, CSS, your server side language of choice, SQL
and an ORM dialect. Hardly single language, but you know what we mean.

11: Adrian Cockcroft specifically mentions "developer self-service" and
"Developers run what they wrote"(sic) in this excellent presentation
<http://www.slideshare.net/adrianco/flowcon-added-to-for-cmg-keynote-talk-on-how-speed-wins-and-how-netflix-is-doing-continuous-delivery>
delivered at Flowcon in November, 2013.

12: We are being a little disengenuous here. Obviously deploying more
services, in more complex topologies is more difficult than deploying a
single monolith. Fortunately, patterns reduce this complexity -
investment in tooling is still a must though.

13: In fact, Dan North refers to this style as /Replaceable Component
Architecture/ rather than microservices. Since this seems to talk to a
subset of the characteristics we prefer the latter.

14: Kent Beck highlights this as one his design principles in
Implementation Patterns
<https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321413091?ie=UTF8&tag=martinfowlerc-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321413091>.


15: And SOA is hardly the root of this history. I remember people saying
"we've been doing this for years" when the SOA term appeared at the
beginning of the century. One argument was that this style sees its
roots as the way COBOL programs communicated via data files in the
earliest days of enterprise computing. In another direction, one could
argue that microservices are the same thing as the Erlang programming
model, but applied to an enterprise application context.
