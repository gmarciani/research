%%%%%%%%%%  Color support  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Color package: xcolor. 
%% Change this if you prefer something else

\usepackage[hyperref,dvipsnames,svgnames,x11names]{xcolor}

%% can add option [table] to xcolor to use color in tables (see xcolor documentation)


%%%%%%%%%%  Hyperlink and line number colors  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\AtBeginDocument{
    % Using color names from xcolor package
    \hypersetup{
    	linkcolor=Blue3,
    	citecolor=Blue3,
    	urlcolor=violet,
    	filecolor=red, 
    %	anchorcolor=yellow,%  not all pdf viewers recognize this field (although Firefox does): hyperref issues a warning
    %	colorscheme=phelype,% overrides link, cite, url, file colors with a preset scheme, through \DocumentMetadata
    	}
    %
    \ifmit@lineno
	    \renewcommand{\linenumberfont}{\sffamily\mdseries\tiny\color{violet}}% line numbers will be sans-serif, medium weight, tiny, and violet
	\fi
}

%%%%%%%%%  Caption support  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 
% see documentation for details of how to customize captions

\RequirePackage{caption}
\RequirePackage{subcaption}


%%%%%%%%%  Customize list environments  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 
% see documentation for details of how to customize lists

%\RequirePackage{enumitem}


%%%%%%%%%  Customize titles and section headings  %%%%%%%%%%
% 
% see documentation for details of how to customize headings

\RequirePackage{titlesec}

% these titlesec commands just automate the bold math in some headings (rest follows default styles)
\titleformat{\section}{\mathversion{bold}\normalfont\Large\bfseries}{\thesection }{1em}{}
\titleformat{\subsection}{\mathversion{bold}\normalfont\large\bfseries}{\thesubsection}{1em}{}
\titleformat{\subsubsection}{\mathversion{bold}\normalfont\normalsize\bfseries}{\thesubsubsection}{1em}{}

% ==> NOT every font includes a bold math version, so you may need to use other math macros in the headings to get bold math <==


%%%%%%%%%  Change page margins  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 
% The default thesis margin is 1 inch all around. You may want different margins (e.g., to add a gutter for binding),
% in which case you can use the \newgeometry command from the geometry package.  Refer to the package documentation
% for details.
%
% mitthesis defaults: [top=1in,bottom=1in,left=1in,right=1in,marginparwidth=50pt,headsep=12pt,footskip=0.5in]
%
% The following tells the geometry package to use a two-sided layout with a 1 cm binding offset on the inside 
% 	and 1 inch margins all around, reducing textwidth slightly (by 0.7 cm). See geometry documentation, Section 8.2.
%
%\newgeometry{twoside, bindingoffset=1cm,margin=1in,marginparwidth=50pt,headsep=12pt,footskip=0.5in}
