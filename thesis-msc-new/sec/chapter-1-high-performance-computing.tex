\chapter{High Performance Computing}

High Performance Computing (HPC) refers to the use of supercomputers and parallel processing techniques to solve complex computational problems. 

From its beginning in the 70s, HPC has evolved to embrace a wide array of applications across scientific research, engineering, financial modeling, artificial intelligence and more. 

HPC represents a significant advancement in computational science and plays a strategic role to enable compute intensive tasks, driving innovation across various sectors. 

The field of HPC has traditionally been dominated by on-premises (on-prem) infrastructures with specialized hardware; however, Cloud computing is now a transformative force in making HPC more flexible and accessible.

This chapter delves into the fundamental concepts of HPC, exploring its architecture, methodologies, applications. We will also dive deep into how Cloud infrastructures, opposed to traditional on-prem, represent a disruptive opportunity for HPC.
