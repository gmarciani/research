\chapter{Conclusions}

The concluding chapter summarizes the key findings of the thesis, reflecting on the implications of cloud-based HPC for the future of scientific computing. 

Based on the findings from the experiments, this chapter presents a set of best practices for optimizing AWS ParallelCluster for different HPC workloads. 

These best practices cover areas such as instance selection, network configuration, storage optimization, and cost management. 

The recommendations are designed to help users achieve the best possible performance and efficiency when deploying HPC workloads on AWS.

We also discuss potential areas for further research and development, particularly in the context of emerging technologies and evolving HPC workloads.
