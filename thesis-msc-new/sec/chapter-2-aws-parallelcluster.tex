\chapter{AWS ParallelCluster}

AWS ParallelCluster is an open-source cluster management tool that makes it easy to deploy, scale and administer HPC clusters on Amazon Web Services (AWS). 

ParallelCluster abstracts much of the complexity involved in creating HPC environments, providing a user-friendly CLI interface to create, update and delete them out of a simple declarative YAML configuration file.

ParallelCluster has a proven track record in empowering scientists and engineers to leverage the robust infrastructure of AWS for their HPC workloads and quickly tailoring their clusters to meet specific requirements. With ParallelCluster they do not need to deal with the low level technicalities of the HPC infrastructure and the operational burden to maintain it and can focus on what really matters for them: workloads and cost optimization.

This chapter delves into the user experience, architecture and key features of AWS ParallelCluster, providing a comprehensive overview of its capabilities and practical applications. It also show how to deploy a cluster and customize it from the ground up with practical step-by-step examples.
