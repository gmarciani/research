\chapter{AWS ParallelCluster}

AWS ParallelCluster is an open-source cluster management tool that makes it easy to deploy, scale and administer HPC clusters on Amazon Web Services (AWS). 

ParallelCluster abstracts much of the complexity involved in creating and fine tuning a complete auto-scaling HPC environment, providing a user-friendly CLI interface.

It has a proven track record in empowering scientists and engineers to leverage the robust infrastructure of AWS for their HPC workloads and quickly tailoring their clusters to meet specific requirements. With ParallelCluster they do not need to deal with the technicalities of the HPC infrastructure and the operational burden to maintain it and can focus on what really matters for them: workloads and cost saving.

This chapter delves into the architecture, key features and user experience of AWS ParallelCluster, providing a comprehensive overview of its capabilities and practical applications. It also examines the flexibility and customization options offered by ParallelCluster, with practical examples.
