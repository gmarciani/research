\section{Introduction}

In this chapter, we detail the experiments conducted to evaluate the performance of AWS ParallelCluster for different HPC workloads, specifically focusing on the OSU Benchmarks and AMG Solvers. 

We outline the experimental setup, including cluster configurations, instance types, and storage options. 

The results of these experiments are presented, analyzed, and compared across various scenarios.
