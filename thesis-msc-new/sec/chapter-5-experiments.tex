\chapter{Experiments}

In this chapter, we detail the experiments conducted to evaluate the performance of AWS ParallelCluster for different HPC workloads, specifically focusing on the OSU Benchmarks and AMG Solvers.

For very experiment, we outline the environment setup, including cluster configurations, benchmarks setup and of course, the interpretation of the results.

\section{OSU Benchmarks}

TODO: Add the results and interpretation of experiments running different OSU benchmarks on different cluster configurations, showing how performance are impacted by some strategic fine tuning.

\section{AMG Solvers}

TODO: Add the results and interpretation of experiments running different AMG solvers on different clusters configurations showing how performance are impacted by some strategic fine tuning.
