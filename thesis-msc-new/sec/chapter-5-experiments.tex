\chapter{Experiments}

In this chapter, we detail the experiments conducted to evaluate the performance of AWS ParallelCluster for different HPC workloads, specifically focusing on the OSU Benchmarks and AMG Solvers.

For very experiment, we outline the environment setup, including cluster configurations, benchmarks setup and of course, the interpretation of the results.

The results of these experiments are presented, analyzed, and compared across various scenarios.

\section{OSU Benchmarks}

TODO: Add the results and interpretation of experiments running different OSU benchmarks on different clusters.

\section{AMG Solvers}

TODO: Add the results and interpretation of experiments running different AMG solvers on different clusters.
