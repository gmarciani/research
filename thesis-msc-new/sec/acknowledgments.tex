I would like to express my deepest gratitude to all those who have supported me throughout this research and my overall course of study.

First and foremost, I would like to thank with all my heart my beloved wife and my parents for always motivating me to conclude my thesis and believing in me in good and bad times.

I thank my sons Edoardo, Arianna and Vittorio because they fill my life with love and their birth has been the strongest motivation to complete my studies.

I thank my grandfather for passing on my passion for computer science to me since I was a child.

A special thanks goes to my friends and colleagues, Antonella, Debora, Gianluca, Giorgio and Michele: we shared joys and sorrows during my university journey and they motivated me to complete my thesis every time we met.

I'd like to thank my advisor, Prof. Salvatore Filippone, whose expertise, encouragement, and insightful feedback were invaluable in shaping this thesis.

I thank Prof. Valeria Cardellini for passing on to me the passion for distributed systems, that shaped my entire career.

Last but not least, I thank my amazing company Amazon Web Services for betting on me even before I finished my studies.
