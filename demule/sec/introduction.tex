\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

There exist many other techniques for pseudo-random number generation. The most notable are \textit{multiple recursive generators}, \textit{composite generators}, and \textit{shift-register generators}. All of these produce periods wider than the one produced by a Lehmer generator, with the cost of computational complexity.
However, we adopt Lehmer generator because it is effective, efficient and widely adopted, thus being perfect for our showcase.
