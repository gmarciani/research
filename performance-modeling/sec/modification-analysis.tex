\section{Modification Analysis}
\label{sec:Modification-Analysis}

The modification analysis is the procedure to evaluate modifications with respect to the achievable performance improvements. The analysis leverages the asymptotic bounds stated in \Cref{sec:Asymptotic-Bounds}.

The modification analysis is computationally feasible, does not rely on any assumption about arrival process, service process or scheduling policy. It is a powerful tool because bounds behavior is what we need when evaluating performance improvements.
