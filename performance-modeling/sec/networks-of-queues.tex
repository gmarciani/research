\section{Networks of Queues}
\label{sec:Networks-Of-Queues}

A network of queues is an architecture where multiple queue nodes are connected with probabilistic routing. Such a network can be 
(i) open, if it receives external arrivals and departures exit the system, or
(ii) closed, if the number of jobs is fixed to a multiprogramming level and it does not have external arrival neither departures exits the system.

Jackson Networks are the simplest network of queues, and they are very useful in modeling packet-routing computer networks.

We define Open Jackson Networks, Closed Jackson Networks and their respective closed-form limiting probabilities.

Furthermore, we present the Local Balance Approach to solve Open Jackson Network, and the Mean Value Analysis to solve Closed Jackson Networks.
