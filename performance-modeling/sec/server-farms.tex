\section{Server Farms}
\label{sec:server-farms}

A server farm is a collection of servers that cooperates to handle incoming requests. 
A server farm is preferable to a super-fat server because it is cheaper and more flexible. This practical advantages have made server farms ubiquitous.

A server farm can be modeled with a $M/M/k/k$ queue and with a $M/M/k$ queue.

These queues are both birth-death processes, thus they are both time-reversible.
