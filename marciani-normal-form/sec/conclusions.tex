\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We introduced the notion of context-free grammar in Marciani Normal Form (MNF).
We proved that a context-free grammar in such a form always generates a regular language.
Such a demonstration states the semi-decidability of the CF Regularity Problem, that is the problem of saying whether or not a context-free grammar generates a regular language.
We gave representative examples of the Marciani's Rule application, showing the simplicity of determining the solution for the CF Regularity Problem.
